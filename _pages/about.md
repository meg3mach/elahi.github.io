I am a postdoctoral researcher based at Stanford Universityâ€™s Hopkins Marine Station. In general, I study the drivers of spatial and temporal change in marine ecosystems. Currently, I am using the Adriatic Sea as a case study to examine the consequences of fisheries closures in the context of a diverse group of stakeholders, including conservation advocates, the fishermen themselves, and other economic sectors. I am also interested in biodiversity and body size change, particularly in the context of recent human impacts.
